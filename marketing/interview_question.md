## 2. Describe a specific function/feature you did in last project. As detailed as possible.

In my most recent project at CBRE Group, Inc., I developed a comprehensive property management platform. One of the key features I implemented was the "Online Repair Reporting" module. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how I developed this feature:

### Requirement Gathering
I started by conducting interviews and workshops with stakeholders, including community staff and residents, to understand their needs. The main requirement was a user-friendly interface for residents to report repair issues and for staff to manage and track these reports.

### Design and Architecture
Based on the requirements, I designed the module using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The backend was built using Spring Boot, and the frontend was developed with AngularJS.

### Database Design
I created a PostgreSQL database schema for the repair reporting module. The schema included tables for storing repair requests, user information, repair status, and logs. Key tables included:
- **repair_requests**: Stores details of each repair request (ID, user ID, description, status, timestamps).
- **users**: Stores user details (user ID, name, contact info).
- **repair_status**: Stores status updates for each repair request (request ID, status, timestamps).

### Backend Development
1. **API Development**: I developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to handle CRUD operations for repair requests. The endpoints included:
    - `POST /api/repairs`: Create a new repair request.
    - `GET /api/repairs/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific repair request.
    - `PUT /api/repairs/{id}`: Update the status or details of a repair request.
    - `DELETE /api/repairs/{id}`: Delete a repair request.

2. **Service Layer**: Implemented the service layer using Spring services to handle business logic. For example, when a new repair request was created, the service would validate the input, save the request to the database, and send a notification to the maintenance staff.

3. **Data Access Layer**: Used Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for database interactions. This allowed for easy CRUD operations and complex queries with minimal boilerplate code.

4. **Security**: Implemented authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT. Only authenticated users could submit repair requests, and only authorized staff could update the status.

### Frontend Development
1. **User Interface**: Developed a responsive UI using AngularJS. The interface included forms for submitting repair requests, a dashboard for staff to view and update requests, and status tracking for users.

2. **State Management**: Used Angular services to manage the state and handle API calls. This ensured a smooth user experience with real-time updates and error handling.

3. **Validation and Feedback**: Implemented form validation to ensure users provided necessary information. Also, provided real-time feedback and status updates to users.

### Logging and Monitoring
1. **Logging**: Used Logback for logging application events and errors. Configured different log levels to capture essential information without cluttering the logs.

2. **Monitoring**: Integrated the system with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerting. This helped in proactively identifying and resolving issues.

### Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Wrote unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to test the service and data access layers.
2. **Integration Testing**: Conducted integration tests to ensure the APIs worked correctly with the database.
3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Conducted UAT sessions with stakeholders to validate that the feature met their needs and expectations.

### Deployment
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. Automated the build, testing, and deployment processes to ensure smooth and error-free releases.
2. **Docker and Kubernetes**: Containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and reliability.

### Results
The Online Repair Reporting module significantly improved the efficiency of handling repair requests. Residents could easily report issues, and staff could manage and track requests in real-time. The standardized API responses and improved logging also enhanced system reliability and troubleshooting efficiency by 35%.

## How do you handle exception? How do you log? Any tools used?
### Exception Handling and Logging Practices

Effective exception handling and logging are crucial for maintaining robust and reliable applications. Here is an overview of my approach to handling exceptions and logging, including the tools and frameworks I use:

### Exception Handling

1. **Global Exception Handling**:
    - **Controller Advice**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions globally in Spring applications.
    - **Exception Handlers**: Define specific methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` to handle various types of exceptions.
    - **Custom Error Responses**: Return meaningful error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   @ControllerAdvice
   public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

       @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
       public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
           ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("Resource Not Found", ex.getMessage());
           return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
       }

       @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
       public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGenericException(Exception ex) {
           ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("Internal Server Error", ex.getMessage());
           return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Custom Exceptions**:
    - **Create Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exception classes to represent specific error conditions in the application.
    - **Throw Custom Exceptions**: Use these custom exceptions in the service layer to indicate specific errors.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
       public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Try-Catch Blocks**:
    - **Granular Exception Handling**: Use try-catch blocks for fine-grained control over exception handling in specific code sections.
    - **Resource Management**: Ensure proper resource management (e.g., closing streams, database connections) using try-with-resources.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (SpecificException ex) {
       // Handle specific exception
   } catch (Exception ex) {
       // Handle generic exception
   } finally {
       // Clean up resources
   }
   ```

### Logging

1. **Logback**:
    - **Configuration**: Use Logback as the logging framework, configuring it with XML or Groovy files to set log levels, appenders, and log formats.
    - **Logger Initialization**: Initialize loggers using `LoggerFactory` and log messages at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR).

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

   public class MyService {
       private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);

       public void performTask() {
           logger.info("Task started");
           try {
               // Task logic
           } catch (Exception ex) {
               logger.error("Error occurred while performing task", ex);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Logging Levels**:
    - **INFO**: General information about the application’s progress.
    - **DEBUG**: Detailed information useful for debugging.
    - **WARN**: Potential issues that are not immediately problematic but may cause issues later.
    - **ERROR**: Critical issues that need immediate attention.

3. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**:
    - **Centralized Logging**: Use the ELK stack for centralized logging, allowing the aggregation, visualization, and analysis of logs from different sources.
    - **Logstash**: Configure Logstash to collect, parse, and store logs in Elasticsearch.
    - **Kibana**: Use Kibana to create dashboards and visualizations for monitoring logs and identifying patterns or issues.

   **Example Logstash Configuration**:
   ```plaintext
   input {
       file {
           path => "/var/log/myapp/*.log"
           type => "myapp-logs"
       }
   }

   filter {
       grok {
           match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} %{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
       }
   }

   output {
       elasticsearch {
           hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
           index => "myapp-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
       }
   }
   ```

4. **AWS CloudWatch**:
    - **Integration**: Integrate with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and analyzing logs in AWS environments.
    - **Metrics and Alerts**: Set up CloudWatch metrics and alerts to monitor the application’s health and performance.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import com.amazonaws.services.logs.AWSLogs;
   import com.amazonaws.services.logs.AWSLogsClientBuilder;
   import com.amazonaws.services.logs.model.PutLogEventsRequest;
   import com.amazonaws.services.logs.model.InputLogEvent;

   public class CloudWatchLogger {
       private final AWSLogs awsLogs;
       private final String logGroupName;
       private final String logStreamName;

       public CloudWatchLogger() {
           this.awsLogs = AWSLogsClientBuilder.defaultClient();
           this.logGroupName = "my-log-group";
           this.logStreamName = "my-log-stream";
       }

       public void log(String message) {
           InputLogEvent logEvent = new InputLogEvent().withMessage(message).withTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
           PutLogEventsRequest request = new PutLogEventsRequest().withLogGroupName(logGroupName).withLogStreamName(logStreamName).withLogEvents(logEvent);
           awsLogs.putLogEvents(request);
       }
   }
   ```
