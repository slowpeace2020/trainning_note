### Detailed Steps for Each Data Flow

1. **User Authentication and Role Management**
    - **User Service** handles user authentication using **SpringSecurity**, **JWT**, and **Redis**.
    - Users log in through the frontend (AngularJS), which communicates with the **User Service** to authenticate credentials and manage sessions.
    - Once authenticated, the **User Service** assigns roles and permissions to users.

2. **Community Asset Management**
    - **Asset Service** manages the community assets through **SpringBoot**.
    - The frontend (AngularJS) allows administrators to register and monitor assets.
