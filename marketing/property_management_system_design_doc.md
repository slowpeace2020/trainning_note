## 1. Introduction

### System Purpose and Overview
The Property Management Platform is designed to improve work efficiency for community staff and enhance customer service quality.

## 5. REST API Design

### User Service
1. **Create User**
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/users`
    - **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "username": "johndoe",
            "password": "password123",
            "email": "johndoe@example.com",
            "role_id": 1
        }
        ```
    - **Response:**
        ```json
        {
            "message": "User created successfully",
            "user_id": 101
        }
        ```

2. **Authenticate User**
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth`
    - **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "username": "johndoe",
            "password": "password123"
        }
        ```
    - **Response:**
        ```json
        {
            "token": "jwt_token_here",
            "expires_in": 3600
        }
        ```

### Asset Service
3. **Get All Assets**
    - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/assets`
    - **Response:**
        ```json
        [
            {
                "asset_id": 1,
                "name": "Swimming Pool",
                "location": "Community Center",
                "status": "Operational"
            },
            {
                "asset_id": 2,
                "name": "Gym",
                "location": "Building A",
                "status": "Under Maintenance"
            }
        ]
        ```

4. **Update Asset Status**
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/assets/{asset_id}`
    - **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "status": "Operational"
        }
        ```
    - **Response:**
        ```json
        {
            "message": "Asset status updated successfully"
        }
        ```

## 6. Data Flow Diagrams

### Data Flow Diagram 1: User Authentication
![Data Flow Diagram 1](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=User+Authentication)

1. User submits login credentials via the frontend.
2. The frontend sends the login request to the User Service.
3. User Service validates the credentials and generates a JWT token.
4. The token is returned to the frontend.
5. The frontend stores the token and uses it for subsequent requests.

### Data Flow Diagram 2: Report Generation
![Data Flow Diagram 2](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Report+Generation)

1. User requests a report via the frontend.
2. The request is sent to the Report Service.
3. Report Service generates the report using EasyPOI and stores it.
4. The report path is returned to the frontend.
5. User can download the report from the provided path.

## 7. Message Queue

### Kafka Integration
- **Purpose:** Used for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Example Use Case:** Notifications for report generation completion.
- **Implementation:**
    - Producer Service (Report Service) sends a message when a report is generated.
    - Consumer Service (Notification Service) receives the message and sends a notification to the user.

## 8. Technical Challenges

### Data Consistency
- **Challenge:** Ensuring data consistency across microservices.
- **Solution:** Implemented distributed transactions using the Saga pattern.

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge:** Maintaining performance under high user load.
- **Solution:** Used Redis for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load by 30%.

### Scalability
- **Challenge:** Scaling the system to handle increasing traffic.
- **Solution:** Deployed services on Kubernetes, enabling horizontal scaling and better resource management.

## 9. AWS Integration

### AWS Services Used
- **Amazon RDS:** Hosted Oracle Database.
- **Amazon S3:** Storage for reports and logs.
- **Amazon EC2:** Instances for deploying microservices.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitoring and logging.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Containerization:** Docker used for containerizing services.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
