            {
                "asset_id": 1,
                "name": "Swimming Pool",
                "location": "Community Center",
                "status": "Operational"
            },
            {
                "asset_id": 2,
                "name": "Gym",
                "location": "Building A",
                "status": "Under Maintenance"
            }
        ]
        ```

4. **Update Asset Status**
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/assets/{asset_id}`
    - **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "status": "Operational"
        }
        ```
    - **Response:**

        }
        ```

## 6. Data Flow Diagrams

### Data Flow Diagram 1: User Authentication
![Data Flow Diagram 1](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=User+Authentication)

1. User submits login credentials via the frontend.
2. The frontend sends the login request to the User Service.
3. User Service validates the credentials and generates a JWT token.
4. The token is returned to the frontend.
5. The frontend stores the token and uses it for subsequent requests.

### Data Flow Diagram 2: Report Generation
![Data Flow Diagram 2](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Report+Generation)

1. User requests a report via the frontend.
2. The request is sent to the Report Service.
3. Report Service generates the report using EasyPOI and stores it.
4. The report path is returned to the frontend.
5. User can download the report from the provided path.

## 7. Message Queue

### Kafka Integration
- **Purpose:** Used for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Example Use Case:** Notifications for report generation completion.
- **Implementation:**
    - Producer Service (Report Service) sends a message when a report is generated.
    - Consumer Service (Notification Service) receives the message and sends a notification to the user.

## 8. Technical Challenges

### Data Consistency
- **Challenge:** Ensuring data consistency across microservices.
- **Solution:** Implemented distributed transactions using the Saga pattern.

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge:** Maintaining performance under high user load.
- **Solution:** Used Redis for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load by 30%.

### Scalability
- **Challenge:** Scaling the system to handle increasing traffic.
- **Solution:** Deployed services on Kubernetes, enabling horizontal scaling and better resource management.

## 9. AWS Integration

### AWS Services Used
- **Amazon RDS:** Hosted Oracle Database.
- **Amazon S3:** Storage for reports and logs.
- **Amazon EC2:** Instances for deploying microservices.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitoring and logging.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Containerization:** Docker used for containerizing services.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.

## 10. Additional Project Insights

### Multithreading Usage
In the Property Management Platform, we used multithreading to handle concurrent processing of visitor check-ins and asset status updates. This ensured that our system could efficiently manage multiple operations simultaneously without performance degradation.

### Builder Design Pattern
The Builder design pattern was employed in the Report Service to construct complex report objects. This pattern helped in managing the creation process, especially when reports required multiple optional parameters and complex configurations.

### Team Composition
As the team leader, I oversaw a team of six members:
- **Backend Developers (2):** Focused on developing and maintaining the microservices.
- **Frontend Developer (1):** Developed the user interface and ensured seamless user experience.
- **QA Engineer (1):** Responsible for testing the platform and ensuring high-quality releases.
- **DevOps Engineer (1):** Managed our CI/CD pipeline, AWS infrastructure, and ensured system reliability.
- **Product Manager (1):** Coordinated requirements and worked with stakeholders to define features.

### Jenkins Pipeline Design
Our Jenkins pipeline for AWS included the following stages:
1. **Code Checkout:** Retrieve the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build:** Compile the code and run unit tests.
3. **Docker Build:** Build Docker images for each microservice.
4. **Security Scan:** Perform security checks on the Docker images.
5. **Deploy to Staging:** Deploy the Docker images to the staging environment on AWS ECS.
6. **Integration Tests:** Run integration tests in the staging environment.
7. **Deploy to Production:** Upon successful tests, deploy the Docker images to the production environment on AWS ECS.
8. **Notification:** Send deployment notifications to the team via Slack.

### Monitoring Strategy
Our monitoring setup included:
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Used for monitoring the health and performance of our AWS resources.
- **Prometheus and Grafana:** Implemented for detailed application metrics and dashboard visualizations.
- **ELK Stack:** Utilized for log aggregation, searching, and analysis.

### Usage Metrics
- **Daily Users:** Approximately 2,000 active users daily.
- **Transactions Per Second (TPS):** Average TPS of 50 during peak hours.
- **Queries Per Second (QPS):** Average QPS of 100 for our database.

### Frontend Story
Our frontend, developed using React, provided an intuitive and responsive interface for users. We focused on creating a seamless user experience with features like real

-time notifications, user-friendly forms for reporting issues, and dashboards for monitoring asset status and visitor information. The frontend communicated with backend microservices via REST APIs, ensuring efficient data exchange and updates.
